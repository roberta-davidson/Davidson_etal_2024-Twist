# Davidson et al 2024 - Twist capture benchmark

Scripts and data used in the benchmarking study of Twist Ancient Human DNA enrichment by Davidson et al. 2024

`eager.sh` is the nf-core/eager script used to process the sequencing data \
`Table_S1.csv` contains the sequencing statistics per library required to plot efficacy and cost/benefit figures \
`bcl2fastq.sh` was used to demultiplex \
`f4_plot.R` was used to plot the results of f4 statistics \
`efficacy_plots.R` was used to plot Figures 2, 3, 4, 6, S1 & S2 \
`qpDstat_f4.sh` was used to run f4 statistics \
`index_hopping_stats2.tsv` contains the count data used to analyse index hopping rate \
`plot_index_hopping.R` was used to plot index hopping figures
